Format to solve All the problems:
	1) Understanding the problem to the fullest.
	2) Knowing the inputs and outputs and then create the algorithm to solve the problem.
	3) Drawing flowchart.
	4) Writing pseudo code.
	5) Actually write the code.
	6) Test the code with various testing inputs and find all the errors and edge cases.
	7) Maintain the written code, by improving performance in any way possible, or by adding features, or by simply documenting it.
All the problems should be solved using the format above.

/*
EX-001:
	Write a program to print out the "Hello, World!" in the output.

	EXTRA:
	Format it, then Build it, and then Run it and also experiment with different formatting methods and ways the "fmt" tool formats.
	Also try to build the binary named with different name.
*/

/*
1) Understanding the problem: printing hello world is not going to be that hard to understand, is it?
2) Inputs: none, output: "Hello, World!", no particular algorithm is needed, just print the damn string.
3) Use some drawing platform and attach the picture of it.
4) Pseudo code => print("Hello, World!")
5) Actual code below:
*/

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}

// 6) No testing needed for a hello world program.
// 7) No maintenance either needed. It's merely a test and a pathway to show how it's done.
